Use the open AI mesh from your Python app. Install the client, send an intent,
and get a routed response from an IICP node.

You do **not** need to run a node to try the client path. Consume first,
provide later.

```
urn:iicp:intent:llm:chat:v1  →  discover  →  select  →  submit
```

---

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade iicp-client
```

Requires **Python ≥ 3.11** and [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/).

## One-line test

```bash
iicp-node query "Hello, mesh."
```

What good looks like:

```bash
iicp-node --help       # shows query, serve, proxy, mcp-gateway, credits, ...
which iicp-node        # points to your Python environment
iicp-node --version    # prints iicp-node 0.7.81 or newer
```

The query command contacts the public directory, discovers a matching live node,
routes your prompt, and prints the response. No account, API key, or local node
is required for this consumer path.

Privacy note: the selected remote node can read the prompt it executes. IICP-CX
keeps key-ready transport/relay paths confidential, but it is not
executor-blind inference. For sensitive data, use local/browser inference or a
fail-closed routing profile.

## MCP gateway safety

`iicp-node mcp-gateway --tools format_json,summarize_text` advertises only the
tools you name. Shell, file, network, browser, credential, system-control and
regulated-decision tools are denied by default. Enabling one requires all four
controls: `--allow-dangerous-tools`, `--authz-policy ID`, `--sandbox container`
and `--audit-redaction` (equivalent `IICP_MCP_*` environment variables exist).
Policy receipts include risk/decision metadata and argument counts, never tool
arguments, prompts, credentials or response content.

## Use from Python

```python
from iicp_client import IicpClient, ChatMessage
import asyncio

async def main():
    reply = await IicpClient().chat_async([
        ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello, mesh.")
    ])
    print(reply.choices[0].message.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Do I need to run a node?

No. Running a node is only needed when you want to provide compute or tools to
the mesh. Start as a client; run a node later when you want to contribute.

## Routing policy profiles

The client applies routing policy **after prompt-free discovery and before the
prompt is sent**. Defaults stay adoption-friendly but keyless plaintext is still
refused.

```bash
iicp-node query "Hello" --routing-profile standard        # default encrypted mesh
iicp-node query "Secret" --routing-profile sensitive      # fail closed: no remote executor
iicp-node query "Hello" --routing-profile eu-restricted   # EU/EEA regions only
iicp-node query "Hello" --routing-profile strict-policy   # requires no-retention manifest
```

```python
from iicp_client import ChatOptions, RoutingPolicy

reply = await IicpClient().chat_async(
    [ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello")],
    ChatOptions(routing_policy=RoutingPolicy(profile="eu_restricted")),
)
```

For stricter deployments, require a minimum policy-manifest identity level
before any prompt leaves the client. This keeps the default open mesh behavior
unchanged, but lets controllers fail closed on self-attested or rotated/revoked
providers.

```python
reply = await IicpClient().chat_async(
    [ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello")],
    ChatOptions(
        routing_policy=RoutingPolicy(
            required_manifest_identity_level="operator_bound",
        ),
    ),
)
```

## Migrate from existing AI tools

Direct call:

```python
# Before: call one vendor endpoint directly.
# After: ask IICP to discover and route by capability.
reply = await IicpClient().chat_async([
    ChatMessage(role="user", content="Summarize this document.")
])
```

Existing OpenAI-compatible tools:

```bash
pip install 'iicp-client[proxy]'
iicp-node proxy
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9483/v1
```

Then point LangChain, Cursor, liteLLM or another OpenAI-compatible tool at that
base URL. Full guide: <https://iicp.network/docs/proxy>

## Provider upgrade note

> **Upgrade note (0.7.81)** — pipx or `--without-pip` provider installs can now
> bootstrap `pip` with `ensurepip` before the hourly self-upgrade. If the
> bootstrap or upgrade still fails, the node reports a concrete updater error
> class in heartbeat metadata instead of silently staying downlevel.
>
> Existing routing-policy and reachability fixes from 0.7.80/0.7.79 remain
> intact.

### Keeping provider nodes current

Provider nodes run an hourly official-registry check by default
(`IICP_AUTO_UPDATE=1`, `IICP_AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S=3600`; minimum 300s).
When PyPI publishes a newer stable release, `serve` runs
`python -m pip install --upgrade iicp-client` and re-execs the node so identity
and cached node tokens are preserved.

If a node is older than 0.7.67, perform one manual upgrade/restart first,
especially for Dockerized Python or TypeScript providers: early updater wiring
did not reliably cover every normal `serve` path. For Docker, use a Compose
`restart: unless-stopped` policy (or `docker run --restart unless-stopped`) so
0.7.81 can intentionally exit from a confirmed tunnel-dead state and let Docker
bring it back cleanly.

---

## Architecture — consumer or provider?

This SDK covers **both** sides of the IICP protocol:

| Role | What you do | Class |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Consumer** | Send AI tasks to the mesh; discover and submit | `IicpClient` |
| **Provider** | Run a node, register with the directory, serve tasks | `IicpNode` |

Consumer and provider can run in the same process. A node that serves requests can also route tasks it can't handle to other mesh nodes (`IicpClient` inside the task handler).

For production provider nodes backed by Ollama/vLLM, the `iicp-node` binary (Rust) and the Python adapter (`pip install iicp-adapter`) provide additional resilience and monitoring. See [iicp.network/docs/node-setup](https://iicp.network/docs/node-setup).

---

## Library quickstart

```python
import asyncio
from iicp_client import IicpClient, ChatMessage

async def main():
    client = IicpClient()

    # chat_async discovers, selects best node, and submits in one call
    response = await client.chat_async(
        messages=[ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello from IICP!")],
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Synchronous wrapper for scripts and notebooks:

```python
from iicp_client import IicpClient, ChatMessage

client   = IicpClient()
response = client.chat([ChatMessage(role="user", content="Hello from IICP!")])
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

## Use as a local API proxy (OpenAI / Ollama / Anthropic compat)

Run a local gateway that speaks the OpenAI, Ollama, and Anthropic HTTP APIs and routes
every request across the IICP mesh — point any tool you already use at it, no code changes.

```bash
pip install 'iicp-client[proxy]'
iicp-node proxy                       # → http://127.0.0.1:9483

export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9483/v1   # OpenAI SDK / LangChain / Cursor / liteLLM
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:9483          # Open WebUI / Continue.dev / aider / Jan
```

Loopback-only consumer (never registers with the directory). Override the port with
`--port` / `IICP_PROXY_PORT`; co-host next to a node with `iicp-node serve --with-proxy`.
Every response carries `Server: iicp-proxy`. Full guide: <https://iicp.network/docs/proxy>

## Configuration

```python
from iicp_client import ClientConfig

config = ClientConfig(
    directory_url = "https://iicp.network/api",  # IICP directory
    timeout_ms    = 30_000,                      # max 120 000 (SDK-04)
    region        = "eu-central",                # prefer nodes in region
)
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `directory_url` | `"https://iicp.network/api"` | IICP directory endpoint |
| `timeout_ms` | `30000` | Request timeout — max 120 000 ms |
| `region` | `None` | Preferred node region |
| `max_retries` | `3` | Retry count for transient errors |
| `routing_epsilon` | `0.05` | ε-greedy exploration probability — with this probability a random node is selected instead of the top-ranked one, promoting discovery of new providers; `0.0` disables; override with `IICP_ROUTING_EPSILON` |
| `routing_policy` | `RoutingPolicy(profile="standard")` | Pre-dispatch remote-routing gate; use `sensitive`, `eu_restricted`, `strict_policy`, or an explicit debug override for special cases |

---

## Discover options

```python
from iicp_client import DiscoverOptions

node_list = await client.discover_async(
    "urn:iicp:intent:llm:chat:v1",
    DiscoverOptions(
        region         = "eu-central",
        model          = "phi3:mini",
        min_reputation = 0.7,
        limit          = 5,
    )
)
nodes = node_list.nodes  # list of Node objects
```

---

## Error handling

```python
from iicp_client import IicpClient, IicpError, ChatMessage

client = IicpClient()
try:
    response = client.chat([ChatMessage(role="user", content="hi")])
except IicpError as e:
    print(f"[{e.code}] {e.message}  (HTTP {e.http_status})")
```

Error codes match the [IICP error reference](https://iicp.network/docs/error-reference) — e.g. `task_timeout`, `capacity_exceeded`, `no_nodes_available`.

---

## Serving as a provider node

```python
import asyncio
from iicp_client import IicpNode, NodeConfig

async def my_handler(task):
    return {"choices": [{"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}}]}

async def main():
    node = IicpNode(NodeConfig(
        node_id="my-node-001",
        endpoint="http://my.public.host:8020",
        intent="urn:iicp:intent:llm:chat:v1",
        model="llama3:8b",
    ))
    token = await node.register()
    stop = node.serve(my_handler, port=8020, node_token=token)
    try:
        await asyncio.Event().wait()  # run until stopped
    finally:
        stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Listen port — default 9484, auto-increment (v0.7.5+)

The official IICP port **9484** is the default listen port (`IICP_PORT`, `--port`).
The `iicp-node` CLI auto-increments to the next free port when 9484 is already in
use, so you can run several nodes on one host without picking ports by hand — the
first binds 9484, the second 9485, the third 9486, and so on. Each node gets its
own port, hence its own NAT pinhole; multiple models served by one node share that
single port. Auto-increment is skipped when you pass an explicit `--public-endpoint`
(you own the port mapping in that case). `IicpNode.serve(port=…)` uses the port you
give it as-is (no auto-increment at the library level).

---

## Backends

A provider node forwards each task to an inference backend. The backend is selected
with `--backend-type` (env `IICP_BACKEND_TYPE`, default `openai_compat`):

| `--backend-type` | Engine | Default backend URL | API |
|------------------|--------|---------------------|-----|
| `openai_compat` | Ollama, LM Studio, any OpenAI-compatible server | `http://localhost:11434` | OpenAI `/v1/*` |
| `vllm` | vLLM OpenAI server | `http://localhost:8000` | OpenAI `/v1/*` |
| `llamacpp` | llama.cpp `llama-server` | `http://localhost:8080` | OpenAI `/v1/*` |
| `anthropic` | Native Anthropic Messages API — first-class Claude | `https://api.anthropic.com` | Anthropic `/v1/messages` |

The `anthropic` backend speaks the Anthropic Messages API directly (not the OpenAI-compat
shim): it translates an IICP `llm:chat:v1` task into a Messages request and translates the
response back to the OpenAI chat-completion shape, so a Claude-backed node looks identical
to an Ollama/vLLM node to any IICP client. Run one with:

```bash
iicp-node serve \
  --backend-type anthropic \
  --backend-api-key "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  --model claude-opus-4-8
```

`--backend-type anthropic` defaults `--backend-url` to `https://api.anthropic.com`, so you
only pass the key and the model. The key is sent as the `x-api-key` header; an
`anthropic-version` header (`2023-06-01`) is added automatically. The Anthropic backend
serves `urn:iicp:intent:llm:chat:v1` only (the Messages API has no completion/embedding
endpoint).

Common serve flags (all also read from env):

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `--backend-type` | `IICP_BACKEND_TYPE` | `openai_compat` | Inference engine (table above) |
| `--backend-url` | `IICP_BACKEND_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Backend base URL |
| `--backend-api-key` | `IICP_BACKEND_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Bearer / `x-api-key` for an auth'd backend |
| `--model` | `IICP_BACKEND_MODEL` | _(auto-detect)_ | Backend model id (e.g. `qwen2.5:0.5b`, `claude-opus-4-8`) |

The SDK is configured entirely through CLI flags and environment variables — there is no
config file.

### Input modalities — text, image, audio

A node advertises the input modalities each model accepts in its capabilities, so clients
can discover a vision- or audio-capable node. The modality set is auto-detected from the
model name:

| Model name contains | Advertised `input_modalities` |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| `vl`, `vision`, `llava` | `text`, `image` |
| `audio`, `voxtral` | `text`, `audio` |
| `omni` | `text`, `image`, `audio` |
| (anything else) | `text` |

These are modalities of the `llm:chat:v1` intent, not separate intents. The directory
supports a `?modality=image|audio` filter on discover so a client can find nodes that
accept a given input type.

---

## NAT traversal — automatic (v0.7.3+)

Since v0.7.3, NAT detection runs automatically on every node startup — no flags needed.
The SDK tries each path in order and picks the best one for your network:

| Tier | When | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| **0** | VPS/cloud (public IP on NIC) or `IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` set | Registers directly with that IP |
| **1a** | Home router with UPnP, no CGNAT | Opens a port-forward via UPnP → registers WAN IP |
| **1b** | CGNAT + IPv6 available + AddPinhole works | Registers IPv6 address with firewall rule |
| **1c** | CGNAT + IPv6 + AddPinhole fails (e.g. FRITZ!Box error 606) | Registers IPv6 GUA anyway + logs guidance |
| **3** | CGNAT + no usable IPv6 | Opens a Quick Tunnel if available → otherwise auto-elects relay |
| **4** | Nothing worked | Serves locally with operator guidance |

### Environment-specific behaviour

**VPS / bare metal** — no action needed. The SDK detects the public IP on the NIC (Tier 0).

**Home router (no CGNAT)** — UPnP opens a port-forward automatically. One pinhole per port,
so three nodes on ports 8020 / 8024 / 8025 open three pinholes.

**CGNAT (carrier-grade NAT, e.g. NetCologne DSLite)** — IPv4 path is blocked by the ISP.
The SDK tries IPv6 instead. If your FRITZ!Box rejects `AddPinhole` with error 606, the SDK
still advertises your IPv6 address (many clients can reach it via stateful firewall) and logs:

```
WARNING: NAT: IPv6 endpoint http://[2a0a:...]:8020 advertised but firewall pinhole
could not be opened. Open manually: FRITZ!Box → Network → Firewall → IPv6.
Alternatively use IICP_RELAY_WORKER_ENDPOINT for relay-as-last-resort fallback.
```

**Docker bridge (`-p 8020:8020`)** — UPnP is skipped (it would reach the Docker NAT, not
your home router). The official image includes `cloudflared`, so if no public endpoint is
configured the node first tries a zero-account Quick Tunnel, then falls back to relay.
The image also sets `IICP_SUPERVISED=1`, so with Docker restart policy enabled a
confirmed tunnel-dead state exits visibly and lets Docker restart the node. For stable
direct hosting, set `IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` so the node knows its real address:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
restart: unless-stopped
environment:
  IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT: "http://your-host-ip:8020"
  IICP_BACKEND_URL: "http://host.docker.internal:11434"
```

Or run with `--network host` to let UPnP work as on bare metal.

**Kubernetes** — set `IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` to the Service IP or external LoadBalancer:

```yaml
env:
  - name: IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT
    value: "http://$(LOAD_BALANCER_IP):8020"
```

### CGNAT + no IPv6 → Quick Tunnel, then relay

When no direct path is possible, the SDK automatically finds a relay:

```
NAT tier=3: no direct or IPv6 endpoint available.
Opening Quick Tunnel...
No tunnel available; auto-electing relay from directory...
Auto-elected relay: relay.example.com:9485
```

With `cloudflared` available, the node registers its own temporary HTTPS tunnel URL.
If that is unavailable, it connects outbound to the elected relay, which forwards inbound
tasks down the relay path. Re-registration happens automatically when either path succeeds.

To use a specific relay instead of auto-electing:
```bash
IICP_RELAY_WORKER_ENDPOINT=relay.example.com:9485 python -m iicp_client.cli serve ...
```

### Running a relay-capable node (relay operators)

```python
node = IicpNode(NodeConfig(
    endpoint="http://relay.example.com:8020",
    intent="urn:iicp:intent:llm:chat:v1",
    relay_capable=True,      # accept RELAY_BIND on TCP port 9485
    relay_accept_port=9485,
    enable_mesh=True,        # advertise relay_capable=True in gossip
))
```

> **Security note**: relay bind authentication is pending ([#510](https://github.com/RobLe3/iicp.network/issues/510)) — only run a relay accept port on networks you trust until the signed-bind mechanism ships.

### Opt-out / override

```bash
IICP_AUTO_DETECT_NAT=false   # disable NAT detection entirely
IICP_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=http://x.x.x.x:8020   # trust this endpoint, skip detection
IICP_TUNNEL=0                # opt out of Quick Tunnel fallback
IICP_TUNNEL_CREATE_MIN_INTERVAL_S=120  # host-wide Quick Tunnel create pacing
IICP_TUNNEL_DEAD_POLICY=auto  # auto|retry|exit|log-only (auto = supervised exit, manual retry)
IICP_SUPERVISED=1             # set by generated services/Docker so supervisors can restart
IICP_AUTO_UPDATE=1            # hourly provider self-update; set 0 to disable
IICP_AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S=3600  # update cadence in seconds; minimum 300
IICP_EXTERNAL_IP_PROBE_URL=https://api.ipify.org  # WAN IP probe (default)
```

## Operator identity

Your **operator identity** is an ed25519 keypair — its public key *is* your `operator_id` (the
directory stores it as `operator_pubkey`). One identity spans every node you run: it binds them to
you (nodes show **`Operated by <your name>` ✓**), earns a
[founder ordinal](https://iicp.network/founders), and rolls each node's credits into one operator
wallet. Your `display_name` is the public, mutable handle; your contact stays local.

```bash
iicp-node init                       # create your key-backed identity (~/.iicp/operator.json)
iicp-node serve --node mynode        # signs an operator→node delegation; binds the node to you
iicp-node operator rename "NewName"  # change your public display_name (signed)
iicp-node operator encrypt           # password-encrypt the secret at rest ($IICP_OPERATOR_PASSPHRASE)
iicp-node operator decrypt           # remove at-rest encryption
```

**The key is the identity** — whoever holds `~/.iicp/operator.json` controls it (its nodes, ordinal,
and wallet); there is no central recovery. Back it up (encrypted), never commit or share it; lose it
and the identity, with its founder ordinal, is gone.
